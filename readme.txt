Prerequisites
A MySql database need to be created prior to operation, if it doesn't exist will be created automatically on initialization in most cases.

The Details of the Router has to be entered in the 'config.php' file before operation, like Host IP, username and password.  If they are not correct or the system is not able to connect to the Hotspot router, will ask for correct credentials in the first screen.

System Users: Who are operating this utility.
3 User levels: Administrator, Unit Head and System users.
Any number of users can be created by the system Admin.  They can be enabled/disabled, edited, deleted and can reset the password also by the admin. A default system admin with username 'admin' and password 'admin' will be created automatically on initialisation. Admin user can reset passwords of all other users.
